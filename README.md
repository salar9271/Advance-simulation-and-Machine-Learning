# **Advanced Simulation and Machine Learning (TIF345/FYM345)**

This repository contains projects completed as part of the **Advanced Simulation and Machine Learning** course at Chalmers University of Technology. The course focused on applying advanced simulation techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms to solve complex problems in the physical sciences.

## **Course Content**
Advanced simulations in the physical sciences benefit from ML methods in multiple ways:
- **Uncertainty quantification** via Bayesian inference.
- **Representation of mathematical models** using ML models, such as neural networks and Gaussian processes.
- **Parametrization and selection of ML models** via regression techniques.

### **Subtopics Covered:**
1. Dimensionality reduction and descriptors for physical systems.
2. Bayesian inference and model selection.
3. Generalized linear models, including Gaussian processes.
4. Advanced regression and regularization techniques.
5. Neural networks.

All these topics were introduced and examined in the context of modeling in the physical sciences.

## **Learning Objectives**
By the end of the course, students were able to:
1. Critically examine the description of systems in the physical sciences using different mathematical models.
2. Rationalize the numerical representation of such models at multiple levels of sophistication.
3. Employ statistical inference and ML methods to evaluate and compare models.
4. Explain, using appropriate terminology, methods from ML and statistical inference.
5. Analyze data and write code in a scientific and ethical manner.

   - Compared cosmological models (ΛCDM vs. wCDM).

2. **[Project 2a: Alloy Cluster Expansions](Project2a/README.md)**  
   - Modeled thermodynamic properties of the Au-Cu alloy using cluster expansion methods.
   - Compared Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, Bayesian analysis, and Automatic Relevance Detection Regression (ARDR).

3. **[Project 2b: Bayesian Optimization](Project2b/README.md)**  
   - Optimized the potential energy surface (PES) of a gold atom using Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes.
   - Compared brute-force, local search, and probabilistic models for efficiency.

4. **[Project 3: A Galton Board on a Rocking Ship](Project3/README.md)**  
   - Investigated the effect of inertia and slope biases on a Galton board system.
   - Applied Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and neural networks to infer system parameters.
